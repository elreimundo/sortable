These methods will each implement different sort algorithms. These algorithms are adapted from the Algorithms course on Coursera, designed by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

The file is presented as a module that can be included in place of (or in parallel with) Ruby's Enumerable module.

Note: any class that includes Sortable must also have an instance method .map that accepts a block and returns an array.
